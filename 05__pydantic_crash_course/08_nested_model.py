# Better organization of related data (e.g., vitals, address, insurance)

# Reusability: Use Vitals in multiple models (e.g., Patient, MedicalRecord)

# Readability: Easier for developers and API consumers to understand

# Validation: Nested models are validated automatically â€” no extra work needed
